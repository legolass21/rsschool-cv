# **About Me**
I am a Python backend developer dedicated to continuous improvement and am currently enhancing my JavaScript skills. I am passionate about web development and have successfully completed various courses by Timur Guev on stepik.org, solving a multitude of programming challenges along the way. I am also committed to consistently improving my English proficiency.

Independently, I developed a project to automate Microsoft account registration using only POST and GET requests via the curl_cffi module. I further extended this project to handle registration for the Microsoft Rewards program, implementing asynchronous requests to automatically earn points.
